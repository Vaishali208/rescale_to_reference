There are two files, a snakefile consisting the codes for calculation in which normalized frequency is calculated from the reference and the maximum fragment length from query is multiplied and the value came after this will be pulled to match the reference distribution. The second file is a script file for plotting the graph using matplotlib,named as plot_graph.py. To run the snakefile we will givce the command - snakemake --cores 1. After running this our graph will be saved in distribution_plot.png .
